        <h1>About Me-- Anna Turek</h1>
        <p>My parents adopted me from Colombia and brought me to America. My hometown is Nyack, New York which is about an hour from New York City. I have a brother that is 6 months younger then me. When I was in first grade, my family moved to China and lived there for two years. It was an amazing cultural experience. I have a dog named Walker back home and I recently adopted a kitten named Freya and brought her up to Syracuse with me. I love to play volleyball, cook, hang out with friends, go on hikes, and rollerblade. </p>
        <p>I am currently a Junior at Syracuse Unviersity. tranferred to last year from the University of Pittsburgh. My major is Psychology and my minor is Information Management and Technology. I hope to study abroad before I graduate in Europe!</p>
