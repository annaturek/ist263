	<h2>Professional Summary</h2>   	
        <p>I've always been the type of person who would be hard on myself no matter the situation. I have always strived to do my best and for myself and others. I believe that obstacles in life are always temporary and it's possible to accomplish things that seem impossible with hard work and determination. In the future, I hope to have a career that connects me with people, grow as a person, and achieve my goal of making a difference in the community. I know I have lots to learn, however, I look forward to all the possibilities and learning experiences that I will endure.</p>
