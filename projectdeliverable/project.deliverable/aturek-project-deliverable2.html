                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>I have lived in Nyack practically my whole life. I live on in South Nyack on Gesner Avenue. The first history of Nyack was during 1675. The natives on the land were a group called the Nyacks. European settlers came and settled in what is now Rockland County. The European settlers farmed the land for about 125 years. Red sandstone and the river were important resources for the Nyack. Nyack grew exponentially and started shipbuilding and building boatyards for transportation. Around 1840, the town started building large factories, railroads, and local shops to draw commuters and shoppers.</p>
